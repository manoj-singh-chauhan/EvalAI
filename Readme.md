Method	Simple Use
Object.keys	Keys list
Object.values	Values list
Object.entries	Pairs list
Object.assign	Merge / shallow copy
Object.freeze	Fully lock
Object.seal	Add/delete block
Object.create	Prototype-based object
Object.defineProperty	Special property rules
Object.getPrototypeOf	Get prototype
Object.setPrototypeOf	Set prototype
structuredClone	Deep copy
JSON.parse/stringify	Old deep copy

obj
Object = key–value pairs
Nested objects allow deep structure
Access with dot/bracket
Loop using for-in / keys / values / entries
Copy = shallow vs deep copy
Useful in almost all real JS applications

React sends POST /login
DNS finds IP
TCP handshake
TLS encryption
Nginx receives request
Node.js route /login matches
Middleware checks password/JWT
Controller queries DB
DB returns user
Node sends back JWT token
React stores token
UI changes to dashboard
This entire flow is internet + networking + backend + frontend working together.
